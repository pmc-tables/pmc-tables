  abstract: "Patients with different liver diseases were studied by discriminant analysis. Groups of patients classified mainly on the basis of liver biopsy findings showed functional differences which permitted a consistent reclassification by discriminant functions using laboratory results. Optimal combinations of laboratory tests for the separation of liver diseases were defined. Different combinations were found, dependent on the subsets of liver diseases studied."

  abstract: "(--)-alpha-Bisabolol has a primary antipeptic action depending on dosage, which is not caused by an alteration of the pH-value. The proteolytic activity of pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of bisabolol in the ratio of 1/0.5. The antipeptic action of bisabolol only occurs in case of direct contact. In case of a previous contact with the substrate, the inhibiting effect is lost."
